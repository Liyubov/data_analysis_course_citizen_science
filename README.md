# Data analysis course for citizen science
## Motivation for the course
Citizen science (similar to community science) is scientific research conducted with participation from the general public (who are sometimes referred to as amateur/nonprofessional scientists).
In a world undergoing rapid change across various dimensions, it is important to involve data driven methods to be able to assess and to follow and assist citizens in their sustainable actions and projects. These methods help assess, support, and motivate citizens in actions and projects, addressing complex issues like biodiversity loss, urban liveability, and local activism.
